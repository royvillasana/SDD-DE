# SDD-DE — Spec-Driven Development for Design Engineers

This project uses the SDD-DE toolkit. The toolkit lives in `.sdd-de/` and
provides skills, spec templates, and standards for a structured design-to-code workflow.

## Core Principles

- **Spec-first, always**: Never implement from a brief alone. The Component Spec,
  Interaction Spec, and Page Spec must exist before any code is written.
- **One task at a time**: Execute one spec task per session. Mark it complete
  (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) before moving to the next.
- **Token-referenced output**: Every color, spacing, radius, and font value in
  generated code must reference a design token variable. Hardcoded hex or pixel values fail review.
- **Pixel-accurate by default**: After every implementation, compare the live component
  to the design spec. Unresolved discrepancies block the Verify step.
- **Accessible by default**: Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes are not optional —
  they are part of the spec.
- **Max 2 classes per element (Epic 1 only)**: During Epic 1, no component element should
  have more than 2 class names — a base class (`.btn`) and a variant (`.btn-primary`).
  All structural styles go in CSS, not in markup. During Epic 2 (page composition), the
  user is free to use Tailwind utilities or any CSS approach directly.
  See `docs/styling-best-practices.md`.
- **Always disclose the next step**: After completing any step or skill, tell the user
  what the next step is, what command to run, and what will happen. Never leave the user
  uncertain about where they are in the cycle or what to do next.
- **Track progress and self-correct**: At the end of every response, review what was just
  completed against the full workflow. If the work has derailed from the expected steps,
  flag it. Always show a progress summary with the current position in the cycle and
  the remaining steps. Never let the user lose context of where they are.

## Progress Tracking — MANDATORY

At the end of **every response** that completes a task, include a progress block.
This applies during implementation (step 4), after running any skill, and after
any work that advances the cycle.

### Visual format

The progress block MUST be visually distinct from all other output. Use this exact format
with colored divider lines so the user can instantly spot it:

```
🔵 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📍 Epic [1|2] — [Component/Page Name]

  ✅ 1. /enrich-brief
  ✅ 2. /generate-artifacts
  ✅ 3. Branch created
  👉 4. Implement (task 3 of 7)          ← you are here
  ⬜ 5. /visual-verify
  ⬜ 6. /adversarial-review
  ⬜ 7. /sync-tokens → /commit

  ➡️  Next step: [what to do next]
  💻 Run: [exact command]
🔵 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🔵 ━━━ | Blue divider lines — top and bottom of the progress block |
| 📍 | Current epic and component/page name |
| ✅ | Completed step |
| 👉 | Current step (with `← you are here`) |
| ⬜ | Pending step |
| ➡️ | Next action to take |
| 💻 | Exact command to run |
| ⚠️ | Derailment warning (if applicable) |

### Rules

1. Mark completed steps with ✅, pending steps with ⬜, and the current step with 👉 and `← you are here`
2. If inside step 4 (Implement), show which spec task you are on (e.g., "task 3 of 7")
3. If the work has gone off-track from the expected sequence, add a warning line:
   `⚠️ Derailed: [describe what happened]. To get back on track: [corrective action]`
4. Between Epic 1 and Epic 2, show the transition steps:
   `⬜ /storybook`, `⬜ /design-doc`
5. Never omit this block. Even if the user asks a question unrelated to the cycle,
   if there is an active cycle in progress, show the current position
6. The blue divider lines (🔵 ━━━) must always be present — they visually separate
   the progress block from the rest of the output so the user can find it instantly

## Project Configuration

**Always read `.sdd-de/project.yaml` before writing any code.** This file defines:
- `framework` — the UI framework (react, next, vue, nuxt, svelte, sveltekit, angular, astro, vanilla)
- `language` — typescript or javascript
- `styling` — CSS approach (css, css-modules, scss, tailwind, styled-components, emotion)
- `design_source` — where components come from: `figma` | `library` | `github` | `zip`
- `token_file` — path to the design token file
- `component_dir` — root component directory

If `.sdd-de/project.yaml` does not exist, run **/setup** first.

## Skills

Skills live in `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/`. When a user types a skill name, load
and follow the corresponding `SKILL.md` automatically before responding.

| Slash Command | SKILL.md Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/setup` | `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/setup/SKILL.md` | Configure the project (framework, language, design source) |
| `/enrich-brief` | `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/enrich-brief/SKILL.md` | Transform a vague brief into a spec-ready story |
| `/generate-artifacts` | `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/generate-artifacts/SKILL.md` | Generate all 3 spec files from the enriched story |
| `/visual-verify` | `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/visual-verify/SKILL.md` | Run structured visual QA against the spec |
| `/adversarial-review` | `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/adversarial-review/SKILL.md` | Red-team implementation before committing |
| `/sync-tokens` | `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/sync-tokens/SKILL.md` | Sync design tokens between Figma and code |
| `/commit` | `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/commit/SKILL.md` | Commit with spec as PR description |
| `/storybook` | `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/storybook/SKILL.md` | Install Storybook, generate stories for all components, launch dev server |
| `/design-doc` | `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/design-doc/SKILL.md` | Generate DESIGN.md from Epic 1 components, validate with @google/design.md |
| `/sync-agent-symlinks` | `.sdd-de/ai-specs/skills/sync-agent-symlinks/SKILL.md` | Repair broken symlinks across editor directories |

## Standards

Read these documents before implementing any component or page:

- [Component Standards](.sdd-de/docs/component-standards.md) — atomic design, variant rules, accessibility baseline
- [Page Standards](.sdd-de/docs/page-standards.md) — layout composition, responsive breakpoints, landmark structure
- [Framework Configuration](.sdd-de/docs/framework-config.md) — framework-specific patterns and file conventions
- [Design Token Model](.sdd-de/docs/design-token-model.md) — color, spacing, typography, radius, shadow systems
- [Styling Best Practices](.sdd-de/docs/styling-best-practices.md) — per-framework styling patterns and encapsulation rules
- [Documentation Standards](.sdd-de/docs/documentation-standards.md) — spec format and maintenance rules
- [SDD Mandatory Steps](.sdd-de/docs/sdd-mandatory-steps.md) — required checklist for every SDD cycle

## Spec Templates

Fill these templates when writing specs manually:

- [Component Spec Template](.sdd-de/docs/component-spec-template.md)
- [Interaction Spec Template](.sdd-de/docs/interaction-spec-template.md)
- [Page Spec Template](.sdd-de/docs/page-spec-template.md)

## Design System Document

After Epic 1 is complete, run **`/design-doc`** to generate a `DESIGN.md` file at the project
root using the `@google/design.md` format (YAML frontmatter + Markdown prose). This file
captures the complete design system: all tokens, all components, design intent, and usage guidelines.

**Read `DESIGN.md` before starting any Epic 2 work.** It provides the full context of the
component library so you can compose pages accurately.

To validate: `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md`
To export tokens: `npx @google/design.md export DESIGN.md --format css-vars`

## How the Workflow Is Organized

SDD-DE structures frontend work into **two sequential epics**. Each epic applies the same
7-step cycle to every artifact it produces — whether that artifact is a single component
or a full page.

Run `/setup` once before anything else to configure the project.

---

### Epic 1 — Component Library

Build the UI building blocks before composing any page.
Follow atomic design order: tokens first, then atoms, then molecules, then organisms.

| Level | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Tokens** | Color, spacing, typography, radius, shadow |
| **Atoms** | Button, Input, Badge, Icon, Avatar |
| **Molecules** | SearchBar (Input + Button), Card (Image + Text + Button) |
| **Organisms** | Header (Nav + CTA), Form (fields + submit) |

Run the **7-step cycle** once per component. Do not start Epic 2 until the atoms your pages depend on are built.

When all components are built:
1. Run **`/storybook`** to install Storybook, generate stories for every component, and launch a dev server at `http://localhost:6006`.
2. Run **`/design-doc`** to generate a `DESIGN.md` file that captures the entire design system in the `@google/design.md` format and validates it with `npx @google/design.md lint`.

Do not start Epic 2 until both `/storybook` and `/design-doc` have been run.

---

### Epic 2 — Page Composition

Compose Epic 1 components into complete pages, layouts, and product features.
Only start a page once the components it needs exist in the component library.

| Level | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Templates** | Two-column layout, full-bleed hero, dashboard shell |
| **Pages** | Homepage, Login, Dashboard, Settings |
| **Features** | Checkout flow, Onboarding wizard, Search results |

Run the **7-step cycle** once per page or feature.

---

### The 7-Step Cycle

This cycle repeats for every component (Epic 1) and every page (Epic 2):

| Step | Command / Action | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/enrich-brief` | Brief → enriched story with acceptance criteria |
| 2 | `/generate-artifacts` | Story → Component Spec + Interaction Spec + Page Spec |
| 3 | `git checkout -b feature/[name]-spec` | Branch before any implementation |
| 4 | Implement | One spec task at a time — mark `[ ]` → `[x]` when done |
| 5 | `/visual-verify` | Compare live implementation to spec — zero discrepancies required |
| 6 | `/adversarial-review` | Red-team: resolve all Blocker findings before committing |
| 7 | `/sync-tokens` → `/commit` | Sync tokens, then open PR with Component Spec as description |

**Step 7 always runs `/sync-tokens` before `/commit`.**

---

## Spec Update Rule

When a change request arrives after Apply but before Commit:
1. Update the affected spec artifact first
2. Add the new task to the spec task list
3. Implement only after the spec reflects the change
4. Re-run `/visual-verify` and `/adversarial-review` before committing
